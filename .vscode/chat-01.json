Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.\n\t2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).\n\nContext management:\n\t1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.\n\t2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.\n\nTool usage guidance:\n\t1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions. Always call 'get_me' first to understand current user permissions and context. ## Issues\n\nCheck 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues. ## Pull Requests\n\nPR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\n\nBefore creating a pull request, search for pull request templates in the repository. Template files are called pull_request_template.md or they're located in '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE' directory. Use the template content to structure the PR description and then call create_pull_request tool.",

They are in different cities and villages across state. There is no mechanism to identify bright students who are performing well in study, sports or other activities. Web portal can be designed to acquire date about such students and can be analyzed on different parameters. What Exact Problem is being solved? : Such identified students can be provided with extra resources or special attention can be given to their upbringing.  Abstract  To identify meritorious students firstly all the educational institutions need to upload the results of students as well as points of extra curriculum activity (activity name, score out of 10 for performance) to the database for a student according to the current class of study. Aadhar number for all the students will always be given (from there students details will be verified).A parent or any other nongovernment institute can also upload scanned copy of result or certificate of any student with his/her Aadhar number and their own details. Admin will Cross-check and verify it for the update in the database. One’s (schools and institutions) first login or registration, there will be a unique token, (user id and password) to the Portal. That login will be further verified. So every institution will have a unique user id and password and students' details will be uploaded yearly and updates will be done twice in a year.  The second fold of the solution is to sort the data according to the merit of students. The designed application will perform the operation with the provided data and present a lesser (according to requirement) students' details. There should be some methods (a faster and optimal Algorithm to sort data by marks and activity score from database Base will be adopted i.e., any tree type-level representation) to sort the data (details) of meritorious students from provided records of all the students.  The third and final part is providing the list of meritorious students to the education department and university. Each official and university will also have a login section. The list of meritorious students will be provided according to year, required field. The education department or university can also post the facilities provided to the selected and shortlisted student as a notice.  Therefore, we are going to solve the stated problem by providing a Web-based application comprising of Web portal and secured database to identify meritorious students in primary education according to data (100%) uploaded and retrieved from several institutions and selected meritorious students list will be provided to (according to specification of different facilities 20-30%) to Education Department and Universities.  Keywords:  Aadhar Number as Primary key of Student Table. Online WEB-portal. Update Records every year to keep a check on the improvement, Standardization \\u0026 Soring data based on Z – stat to filter out the meritorious students on the basis of acads and extra-curricular activities. Tree type-level representation of Database i.e. Admin – Institute – Student. Use Case :- Choice Based selection of meritorious student from data set. For instances if the requirement is only limited to academics, they can refer to the website to fetch a list of top scorers say top 100 or top 200 students. Again if the requirement is limited to selection of Extra-curricular activity like – singing, painting, dancing etc they can fetch the list of students having expertise in that particular field only. Identification of poor meritorious students and Funding based support from different NGO’s, organizations and donations if they want to provide. Supervising data based on entries done in every year (Region based) to keep a check on the individual growth of a student. For instances, a diligent student say X has been receiving scholarship every year now say that X student’s data has not been registered in Database in the next year. Thus there is a decay of GDP in the sample space. To highlight the social issues such as Child Labour, child trafficking, by year wise regulation Data. To prevent the girl child marriage on the basis of Dataset by the investigation Team. For instance if a girl found not registering in the consecutive Year, an investigation team can take action accordingly. Special Features: The school should submit their data to get a recognition as well as to be in sight of fund providing parties (governmental or non-governmental). Students will be benefited as direct communication is in between officials and student and no middle man in between. • Data analysis will be the key point to identification using assignment of z-marks by standard normal distribution. Technology Stack:  We are to make a Web-based app, in a microlithic structure format, where the app structure is broken into different fragments, which does the different job. One part will be taking in the to the database from a web portal designed using CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Servlet. Computation of the sorted data and the various mathematical calculations i.e. arranging the sorted data according to given criteria etc on a mathematical platform powered by JAVA. Another part will be integrated with the API's of various Education Department and Universities to provide them up with shortlisted meritorious students, integrating with their personal choices and cut-offs, and also where shortlisted students will be notified by notice posted. Keeping in mind the ease of obtaining marks and details which has increased throughout the years. In the web app, after one's first login or registration, each part of the education department, university and institution have a unique token, (user id and password) to the database. Coming to the part of its database, My SQL or Oracle or Mongo DB can be used with a firmed dashboard powered by python or JavaScript on a network frame. Since the app will be containing huge academic details of many students, so a strong encryption algorithm is to be used for data integrity and data security. AES-256 or MD5 would be best to use to protect the data in the database and for authentication Biometric data will also be preserved.\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/jstjyoti/Smart-India-Hackathon--team-DigIndia-\",\"stargazers_count\":9,\"forks_count\":4,\"open_issues_count\":0,\"updated_at\":\"2025-10-08T00:55:17Z\",\"created_at\":\"2018-05-21T09:49:52Z\",\"private\":false,\"fork\":false,\"archived\":false,\"default_branch\":\"master\"},{\"id\":143104711,\"name\":\"Evolvve-Student-Chapter-App\",\"full_name\":\"NishkarshRaj/Evolvve-Student-Chapter-App\",\"description\":\"Evolution is the process which makes someone/something ordinary to extra ordinary.

They are in different cities and villages across state. There is no mechanism to identify bright students who are performing well in study, sports or other activities. Web portal can be designed to acquire date about such students and can be analyzed on different parameters. What Exact Problem is being solved? : Such identified students can be provided with extra resources or special attention can be given to their upbringing.  Abstract  To identify meritorious students firstly all the educational institutions need to upload the results of students as well as points of extra curriculum activity (activity name, score out of 10 for performance) to the database for a student according to the current class of study. Aadhar number for all the students will always be given (from there students details will be verified).A parent or any other nongovernment institute can also upload scanned copy of result or certificate of any student with his/her Aadhar number and their own details. Admin will Cross-check and verify it for the update in the database. One’s (schools and institutions) first login or registration, there will be a unique token, (user id and password) to the Portal. That login will be further verified. So every institution will have a unique user id and password and students' details will be uploaded yearly and updates will be done twice in a year.  The second fold of the solution is to sort the data according to the merit of students. The designed application will perform the operation with the provided data and present a lesser (according to requirement) students' details. There should be some methods (a faster and optimal Algorithm to sort data by marks and activity score from database Base will be adopted i.e., any tree type-level representation) to sort the data (details) of meritorious students from provided records of all the students.  The third and final part is providing the list of meritorious students to the education department and university. Each official and university will also have a login section. The list of meritorious students will be provided according to year, required field. The education department or university can also post the facilities provided to the selected and shortlisted student as a notice.  Therefore, we are going to solve the stated problem by providing a Web-based application comprising of Web portal and secured database to identify meritorious students in primary education according to data (100%) uploaded and retrieved from several institutions and selected meritorious students list will be provided to (according to specification of different facilities 20-30%) to Education Department and Universities.  Keywords:  Aadhar Number as Primary key of Student Table. Online WEB-portal. Update Records every year to keep a check on the improvement, Standardization \\u0026 Soring data based on Z – stat to filter out the meritorious students on the basis of acads and extra-curricular activities. Tree type-level representation of Database i.e. Admin – Institute – Student. Use Case :- Choice Based selection of meritorious student from data set. For instances if the requirement is only limited to academics, they can refer to the website to fetch a list of top scorers say top 100 or top 200 students. Again if the requirement is limited to selection of Extra-curricular activity like – singing, painting, dancing etc they can fetch the list of students having expertise in that particular field only. Identification of poor meritorious students and Funding based support from different NGO’s, organizations and donations if they want to provide. Supervising data based on entries done in every year (Region based) to keep a check on the individual growth of a student. For instances, a diligent student say X has been receiving scholarship every year now say that X student’s data has not been registered in Database in the next year. Thus there is a decay of GDP in the sample space. To highlight the social issues such as Child Labour, child trafficking, by year wise regulation Data. To prevent the girl child marriage on the basis of Dataset by the investigation Team. For instance if a girl found not registering in the consecutive Year, an investigation team can take action accordingly. Special Features: The school should submit their data to get a recognition as well as to be in sight of fund providing parties (governmental or non-governmental). Students will be benefited as direct communication is in between officials and student and no middle man in between. • Data analysis will be the key point to identification using assignment of z-marks by standard normal distribution. Technology Stack:  We are to make a Web-based app, in a microlithic structure format, where the app structure is broken into different fragments, which does the different job. One part will be taking in the to the database from a web portal designed using CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Servlet. Computation of the sorted data and the various mathematical calculations i.e. arranging the sorted data according to given criteria etc on a mathematical platform powered by JAVA. Another part will be integrated with the API's of various Education Department and Universities to provide them up with shortlisted meritorious students, integrating with their personal choices and cut-offs, and also where shortlisted students will be notified by notice posted. Keeping in mind the ease of obtaining marks and details which has increased throughout the years. In the web app, after one's first login or registration, each part of the education department, university and institution have a unique token, (user id and password) to the database. Coming to the part of its database, My SQL or Oracle or Mongo DB can be used with a firmed dashboard powered by python or JavaScript on a network frame. Since the app will be containing huge academic details of many students, so a strong encryption algorithm is to be used for data integrity and data security. AES-256 or MD5 would be best to use to protect the data in the database and for authentication Biometric data will also be preserved.\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/jstjyoti/Smart-India-Hackathon--team-DigIndia-\",\"stargazers_count\":9,\"forks_count\":4,\"open_issues_count\":0,\"updated_at\":\"2025-10-08T00:55:17Z\",\"created_at\":\"2018-05-21T09:49:52Z\",\"private\":false,\"fork\":false,\"archived\":false,\"default_branch\":\"master\"},{\"id\":143104711,\"name\":\"Evolvve-Student-Chapter-App\",\"full_name\":\"NishkarshRaj/Evolvve-Student-Chapter-App\",\"description\":\"Evolution is the process which makes someone/something ordinary to extra ordinary.

Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.\n\t2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).\n\nContext management:\n\t1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.\n\t2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.\n\nTool usage guidance:\n\t1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions. Always call 'get_me' first to understand current user permissions and context. ## Issues\n\nCheck 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues. ## Pull Requests\n\nPR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\n\nBefore creating a pull request, search for pull request templates in the repository. Template files are called pull_request_template.md or they're located in '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE' directory. Use the template content to structure the PR description and then call create_pull_request tool.",

You just connected your first MCP server to GitHub Copilot! 🎉\n\n🚨 The teachers have been busy opening new issues in your repository with bugs and feature requests! Go [take a look](https://github.com/{{full_repo_name}}/issues) - so many good ideas!\n\nWe should probably look into them and start researching for other upgrades. Fortunately, with an MCP server for GitHub, triaging these and even doing some research to get ahead should be pretty quick! 🕵️\n\n### 📖 Theory: How MCP Tool Calling Works in Agent Mode\n\nNow that we have the GitHub MCP connected, let's look at how **agent mode** actually uses these external tools.\n\nWith every prompt you send, Copilot also includes the catalog (list + schema) of available tools. Copilot can then plan and decide:\n\n- Is any tool needed for this request?\n- Which tool(s) best match the intent?\n- What arguments (per each tool's input schema) should be passed?\n\nCopilot then executes the chosen tool call(s) and streams results back to the LLM.\n\n![Flowchart diagram illustrating how a user interacts with Copilot Agent Mode](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/how-it-works.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can also explicitly nudge Copilot to call a specific tool by including `#<tool_name>` in your prompt (e.g `#create_pull_request`, `#codebase`).\n\nFrom here, Copilot can use a set of GitHub‑aware tools to do more than just read or edit code in your repo. Here are a few things you can ask it to do:\n\n- Discover similar public projects to get inspiration.\n- Search issues considering description, comments, and likes.\n- Turn the new ideas you like into issues right away so you don’t lose them.\n- Retrieve an issue, make changes on a branch, and start a pull request.\n\nIsn't that cool?! Now let's do it! 👩‍🚀\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Quickly find and save ideas\n\nLet's put the GitHub MCP server to use by researching, comparing, and capturing enhancement ideas!\n\n1. Close any open files inside your codespace. This will help reduce unnecessary context.\n\n1. Ensure the **Copilot Chat** panel is open and **Agent** mode is selected. Verify the MCP server tools are also still available.\n\n1. Ask Copilot to search GitHub for projects similar to this one.\n\n   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=social&logo=github%20copilot)\n   >\n   > ```prompt\n   > Search for any other repositories for organizing extra curricular activities\n   > ```\n\n1. When an MCP tool is required, Copilot may ask for permission. **Verify the request** and modify if necessary, then click **Continue**.\n\n   <img width=\"250\" alt=\"request permission dialog\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/229473af-c206-47a4-b356-943b9c9bd946\" />\n\n1.

Reminder: **verify the request** before running.\n\n   <img width=\"250\" alt=\"request permission dialog\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52635294-950a-4168-b71e-498eb769f3af\" />\n\n1. Since we are done researching, let's finish this chat session to clear the context. At the top of the **Copilot Chat** panel, click the **New Chat** icon (plus sign).\n\n1. With the new issues created, Mona should already be busy checking your work. Give her a moment and keep watch in the comments. You will see her respond with progress info and the next lesson.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) landscape is quickly evolving. Many servers, including the [Official GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) are in active development and do not have full parity with their stable APIs.\n```\n\n",

More teachers are asking to use it! 🎉\n\nOur fellow teachers have lots of ideas but we can't seem to keep up with all the requests! 😮 To fix this issue, lets give GitHub Copilot an upgrade by enabling Model Context Protocol (MCP). To be more specific, we will add the GitHub MCP server, which will enable a combined workflow of issue management and website upgrades. 🧑‍🚀\n\nLet's get started!\n\n### 📖 Theory: What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?\n\n[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is often referred to as \"USB-C for AI\" - a universal connector that allows GitHub Copilot (and other AI tools) to seamlessly interact with other services.\n\nEssentially, it is a way to describe the capabilities and requirements of a service, so AI tools can easily determine what methods to use and to accurately provide the parameters. An MCP server is providing that interface.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Developer] -->|Uses| B[GitHub Copilot]\n    B -->|Unified API| MCP[Model Context Protocol]\n\n    MCP <-->|Unique API| C[(GitHub)]\n    MCP <-->|Unique API| D[(Slack)]\n    MCP <-->|Unique API| E[(Figma)]\n\n    style B fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n\n    subgraph \"Less Context Switching, More Coding\"\n        B\n        MCP\n        C\n        D\n        E\n\n    end\n```\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Get to know your environment\n\nBefore we dive into MCP, let's start up our development environment and refamiliarize ourself with the extracurricular activity application.\n\n1. Right-click the below button to open the **Create Codespace** page in a new tab. Use the default configuration.\n\n   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/{{full_repo_name}}?quickstart=1)\n\n1. Validate the **Copilot Chat** and **Python** extensions are installed and enabled.\n\n   <img width=\"300\" alt=\"copilot extension for VS Code\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef1ef984-17fc-4b20-a9a6-65a866def468\" /><br/>\n   <img width=\"300\" alt=\"python extension for VS Code\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3040c0f5-1658-47e2-a439-20504a384f77\" />\n\n1. Verify our application runs before modification. In the left sidebar, select the **Run and Debug** tab and then press the **Start Debugging** icon.\n\n   <details>\n   <summary>📸 Show screenshot</summary><br/>\n\n   <img width=\"300\" alt=\"run and debug\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b27f2a-5eab-4827-9343-ab5bce62357e\" />\n\n   </details>\n\n   <details>\n   <summary>🤷 Having trouble?</summary><br/>\n\n   If the **Run and Debug** area is empty, try reloading VS Code: Open the command palette (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`) and search for `Developer: Reload Window`.\n\n   <img width=\"300\" alt=\"empty run and debug panel\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dbf1407-3a97-401a-a630-f462697082d6\" />\n\n   </details>\n\n1.

Inside your codespace, open the **Copilot Chat** panel and verify **Agent** mode is selected.\n\n   <img width=\"200\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201e08ab-14a0-48bf-824e-ba4f8f43f8ab\" />\n\n   <details>\n   <summary>Agent mode missing?</summary><br/>\n\n   - Verify VS Code is at least `v1.99.0`.\n   - Verify the Copilot extension is at least `v1.296.0`.\n   - Check if Agent mode is enabled in your [user or workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_workspace-settings).\n\n      <img width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/407a79dd-707e-471b-b56b-1938aece4ad8\" />\n\n   </details>\n\n1. Inside your codespace, navigate to the `.vscode` folder, and create a new file named `mcp.json`. Paste the following contents:\n\n   📄 **.vscode/mcp.json**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"servers\": {\n       \"github\": {\n         \"type\": \"http\",\n         \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. In the `.vscode/mcp.json` file, click the **Start** button and accept the prompt to authenticate with GitHub. This has just informed GitHub Copilot of the MCP server's capabilities.\n\n   <img width=\"350\" alt=\"mcp.json file showing start button\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15a3d885-1c13-40b4-8d59-87b478ddd8a0\" />\n\n   <img width=\"350\" alt=\"allow authentication prompt\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5ec128d-9924-454b-8ab4-3f43ebc83cfc\" /><br/>\n\n   <img width=\"350\" alt=\"mcp.json file showing running server\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c413c52d-94dc-429f-91e0-3486141908b9\" />\n\n1.

It is only to simplify this exercise.\n\n1. Now that your MCP server configuration is pushed to GitHub, Mona should already be busy checking your work. Give her a moment and keep watch in the comments. You will see her respond with progress info and the next lesson.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The next steps will involve creating GitHub issues. If you would like to avoid notification emails, you can unwatch the repository.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Having trouble?</summary><br/>\n\nMake sure:\n\n- Your `.vscode/mcp.json` file is similar to the example provided.\n- You pushed the changes to the `main` branch.\n\n</details>\n````\n\n",

Please fix this.\n\nHere are my ideas, maybe in a toolbar above the activity cards.\n\n- Add some filters, for example by category. If needed, add a field to the JSON.\n- Add options to sort, for example by name or time. If needed, add a date field but leave the textual description version of the time.\n- Add a free text search.\n\nObviously, make sure it still looks good on desktop and phone.\n\n----- COMMENTS -----\nThis will be so useful. We should be proactive and do this before the list gets even longer.\nLet's do it! I would love to help out. I just took a coding class. 🤓\n```\n\n",

Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.\n\t2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).\n\nContext management:\n\t1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.\n\t2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.\n\nTool usage guidance:\n\t1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions. Always call 'get_me' first to understand current user permissions and context. ## Issues\n\nCheck 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues. ## Pull Requests\n\nPR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\n\nBefore creating a pull request, search for pull request templates in the repository. Template files are called pull_request_template.md or they're located in '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE' directory. Use the template content to structure the PR description and then call create_pull_request tool.",

Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.\n\t2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).\n\nContext management:\n\t1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.\n\t2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.\n\nTool usage guidance:\n\t1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions. Always call 'get_me' first to understand current user permissions and context. ## Issues\n\nCheck 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues. ## Pull Requests\n\nPR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\n\nBefore creating a pull request, search for pull request templates in the repository. Template files are called pull_request_template.md or they're located in '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE' directory. Use the template content to structure the PR description and then call create_pull_request tool.",

Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.\n\t2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).\n\nContext management:\n\t1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.\n\t2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.\n\nTool usage guidance:\n\t1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions. Always call 'get_me' first to understand current user permissions and context. ## Issues\n\nCheck 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues. ## Pull Requests\n\nPR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\n\nBefore creating a pull request, search for pull request templates in the repository. Template files are called pull_request_template.md or they're located in '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE' directory. Use the template content to structure the PR description and then call create_pull_request tool.",

Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.\n\t2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).\n\nContext management:\n\t1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.\n\t2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.\n\nTool usage guidance:\n\t1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions. Always call 'get_me' first to understand current user permissions and context. ## Issues\n\nCheck 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues. ## Pull Requests\n\nPR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\n\nBefore creating a pull request, search for pull request templates in the repository. Template files are called pull_request_template.md or they're located in '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE' directory. Use the template content to structure the PR description and then call create_pull_request tool.",
